## Campus Belloch
Campus Belloch is just 30 minutes from Barcelona, yet you will find yourself surrounded by greenery as far as the eye can see, thanks to a 200 hectare estate with a private park for relaxation.

Surrounded by forests and mountains, it is only natural that the preservation of the environment is of special importance to the Campus. The minimalist architecture of the Campus works in harmony with its surroundings and has been designed with sustainability as a top priority.
