We are now opening the project submissions for 2024! 

This year each project can have a maximum of two project leads, who will design and submit the project. At least one project lead and another project member (co-lead where possible) should attend the event in person. **The deadline for project submissions is 8 April 2024.**

[Submit your project](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/34082/submitter){: .button .is-size-5 .is-inline-block .mt-2 .mb-5}

## General guidelines and instructions
The Oxford Abstracts submission form is descriptive and will guide your answers, but overall you would need to answer three main questions:

 1. **Scope and vision** of your project
 2. **Alignment** with the newly commenced [ELIXIR 2024-26 Programme](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/what-we-do/elixir-programme) and beyond
 3. **Feasibility** of your proposal
	
BioHackathon is about collaboration, building practical solutions, learning, working and having fun, together. It is a place for projects to kickstart or for others to be progressed. We also want to encompass a lot of new participants and outreach our efforts.

Therefore, **we encourage new Project Leads to participate and also will look at collaborations and interplays with industry in a positive light.** 

Following the deadline, our BioHackathon Programme Committee will review your submissions. We aim to inform all co-leads with regards to the status of their project submission in May 2024. In the case of similar submissions, we might propose your project to be merged with another.
