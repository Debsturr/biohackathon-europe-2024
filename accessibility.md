We have tried to make the site easy to use and understand, no matter what technology or browsing method you are using. For example, you should be able to:

  * change colours, contrast levels and fonts
  * zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
  * navigate the website using just a keyboard
  * listen to most of the website using a screen reader.

We aim to conform to the to the 'AA' standard of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). This is not just a legal requirement in the European Union, but a best practice that will enable as many people as possible to use the site.
